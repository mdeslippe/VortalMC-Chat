The official bungee-server chat plugin for VortalMC. This plugin provides a rich variety of chat-related commands, and events, as well as fully configurable cross-server chat channels. When developing this plugin, customization was the top priority, so everything in this plugin is fully configurable. 

This plugin hooks into [LuckPerms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms.28140/) to enable the meta-management of players via LuckPerms as well as built-in meta management utilities such as prefixes, suffixes, nicknames, name colors, chat colors, etc.

This plugin also hooks into [LiteBans](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/litebans.3715/) to enable player-muting capabilities.

## Installation
To Install the plugin, you must do the following:

1. Place the compiled jar file into the plugins directory on your bungeecord server
2. Restart the server
3. Configure your MySQL database information in the config.yml configuration file
4. Exectue the command /vortalmcchat reload or restart the server
